        High school student Yuuta Okkotsu is plagued by violent misfortunes due to bullying, but he holds a powerful curse that allows him to seek brutal revenge. The source of the curse is Rika Orimoto, a shadow from his tragic past that looms as a lethal threat to anyone who does him wrong. Satoru Gojou, a sorcerer at Tokyo Jujutsu High, recognizes Yuuta's unique potential and tries to help him turn his curse into a force for good. However, Yuuta struggles to find his place among his talented classmates, including Toge Inumaki, Maki Zenin, and Panda. While Yuuta tries to use Rika's power to aid his friends, Suguru Getou, a curse user, seeks to exploit Rika's strength and eliminate all non-jujutsu users from the world. Yuuta must fight against Getou's genocidal plot with the help of his comrades.
